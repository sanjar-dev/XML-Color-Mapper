A little tool to make your life a little easier with figuring out bounds of `.xml` files in your Friday Night Funkin' mod :godmode:.

**NOTE:** `example.xml` is not viable to map.

1. Place your files in `data/` folder. There must be your .xml and .png files with the same name.
2. Launch **Command Prompt** within the folder the project is.
3. Type `python map.py your-file.xml` in prompt.
4. If everything works fine, it'll print that your file is saved in data folder that you can use.
