# Sparrow XML Sprite Sheet Bound Mapper

A little tool to make your life a little easier with figuring out bounds :rage2: of .xml files in your Friday Night Funkin' mod.

**NOTE:** `example.xml` is not viable to map.

## How to use

### Requierments:
- Python *(preferably 3.9)*
- Basic terminal knowledge *(like really basic)*

### Windows:
1. Place your files in data folder (there should be .xml and .png files with the same name).
2. Launch Command Prompt within the folder the project is.
3. Type `python map.py your-file.xml` in prompt.
4. If everything works fine, it'll print that your file is saved in data folder that you can use.

### Mac and Linux:
I only tested it on Windows since it is where I wrote the program. Try to repeat the steps that are written to Windows.
